        <h1>About</h1>
	<p>LLMs have revolutionised human communication, but we can find further efficiencies! Just The Prompt allows you to share the raw source prompt, which the recipient can expand to fulsome textual content at their leisure, saving both on bandwidth and storage. Each message serves as its own summary - and yet there is no need to worry about detail being lost. The detail will be generated as required on a Just-In-Time basis.<br>
Further, now each raw message can be a living document - as generative AI models increase in power and complexity, old prompts can be re-pasted and enjoyed afresh with renewed and improved eloquence and intelligence.
<br>
Or, if you value time and brevity you may be able to culivate the skill of looking at the prompt and <i>guessing</i> what the LLM may produce, safe in the knowledge that as much clarifying detail as necessary can still be brought forward on command. But who knows - perhaps the day will come when we can communicate with prompts alone!</p>
